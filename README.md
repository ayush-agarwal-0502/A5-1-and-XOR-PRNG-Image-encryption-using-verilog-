This repository contains our work on the problem statment for PS2 of I-CHIP 22 , the verilog event of UDYAM , which is the electronics department fest of IIT BHU .
We have encrypted an image using 2 different algorithms ( whose details have been split as Design 1 and Design 2 respectively ) . Image encryption is essential for secure transmission of image data over communication lines hence this project is valuable one . 

## The PS :
